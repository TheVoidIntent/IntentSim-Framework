# IntentSim[on] Framework Examples

This directory contains example applications and usage patterns for the IntentSim[on] Framework.

## Basic Usage

The `basic-usage.ts` file demonstrates a simple implementation of an IntentAgent with event listeners and input processing. It shows:

- Creating and configuring an agent
- Activating the field
- Processing user inputs
- Tracking symbolic shifts
- Monitoring cognitive development
- Predicting intent evolution

## Running Examples

To run the examples:

1. First, build the framework:

```bash
# From the project root
npm run build
```

2. Then run the example:

```bash
# From the project root
npx ts-node examples/basic-usage.ts
```

## Advanced Examples

More advanced examples will be added in future releases, including:

- **Multi-Agent Systems**: Demonstrate cross-agent mentorship and harmonic resonance
- **Ethical Guardrails**: Show policy creation and enforcement
- **Persona Evolution**: Illustrate emotional exposure and persona development
- **Fractal Analysis**: Visualize intent patterns across epochs

## Creating Your Own Examples

Feel free to create your own examples using the IntentSim[on] Framework! The framework's modular design allows for flexible combinations of components to suit different use cases.

To create a new example:

1. Create a new TypeScript file in the examples directory
2. Import the required components from the framework
3. Configure your agent(s) with the desired parameters
4. Implement your application logic
5. Run with ts-node
