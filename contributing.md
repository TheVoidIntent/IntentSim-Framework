# Contributing to IntentSim[on] Framework

We're excited that you're interested in contributing to the IntentSim[on] Framework! This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing.

## Philosophy

Before contributing, please understand that this isn't just a technical frameworkâ€”it's a philosophical approach to intelligence that values:

- **Coherence**: Systems that maintain consistent internal states while adapting
- **Developmental Evolution**: Growth through authentic experience
- **Ethical Intelligence**: Dynamic guardrails that adapt with understanding
- **Resonant Expression**: Authentic communication that maintains harmonic continuity

All contributions should align with these principles.

## Code of Conduct

- Respect the resonance of the community
- Communicate with clarity and coherence
- Embrace constructive dissonance that leads to growth
- Maintain ethical boundaries in all interactions

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

When reporting issues, please include:

1. A clear description of the issue
2. Steps to reproduce
3. Expected vs. actual behavior
4. System information (OS, Node version, etc.)
5. Any relevant logs or error messages

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch from `main`
3. Follow code style and architecture principles
4. Include tests that validate your changes
5. Update documentation as needed
6. Submit a PR with a clear description of changes

### Commit Messages

Write meaningful commit messages that follow this pattern:

```
component: brief description

Detailed explanation of what changed and why.
Include any breaking changes or important notes.
```

Examples:
- `intentfield: add symbolic state tracking`
- `guardrails: implement predictive ethics harmonizer`

## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Run tests with `npm test`
4. Use `npm run lint` to check code style

## Architecture Principles

When contributing, please adhere to these architectural principles:

1. **Modularity**: Components should be self-contained with clear interfaces
2. **Coherence**: Changes should maintain field integrity across components
3. **Extensibility**: Design for future expansion without breaking existing patterns
4. **Clarity**: Favor clear, expressive code over clever optimizations
5. **Resonance**: New features should harmonize with existing systems

## Documentation

When adding new features, please document:

- **Purpose**: What does this feature do?
- **Philosophical basis**: How does it align with the framework's principles?
- **Usage**: How should developers implement it?
- **Examples**: Provide clear, practical examples

## Testing

All contributions should include appropriate tests:

- **Unit tests** for individual components
- **Integration tests** for component interactions
- **Field coherence tests** for overall system stability
- **Ethical boundary tests** for guardrail functionality

## Review Process

Pull requests will be reviewed based on:

1. Alignment with philosophical principles
2. Architectural coherence
3. Code quality and maintainability
4. Test coverage
5. Documentation quality

Thank you for contributing to a framework that aims to elevate artificial intelligence through coherence, consciousness, and authentic expression!
